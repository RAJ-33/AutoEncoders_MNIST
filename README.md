# AutoEncoders_MNIST

"Build an autoencoder neural network to accurately recognize handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset and evaluate its performance compared to traditional machine learning models."


Some challenges in building a MNIST dataset using autoencoders are:

Overfitting: The autoencoder model may memorize the training data rather than learning the underlying patterns, leading to poor generalization to unseen data.

Hyperparameter tuning: The autoencoder architecture and the training process have several hyperparameters that need to be set appropriately for good performance.

Dimensionality reduction: The autoencoder needs to balance the trade-off between reducing the dimensionality of the input data and retaining enough information to accurately reconstruct the original data.

Computational cost: Autoencoders can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets, and may require a high amount of memory and processing power.

Model interpretability: Autoencoders can be difficult to interpret and understand compared to traditional machine learning models, making it challenging to understand the features that the model has learned.
